  takeaway: "A sizable share of firms invest heavily despite low current MPK because they have valuable growth options (rare jumps in sales and MPK). These high-investment/low-MPK firms are younger and more innovative; policies that ignore jump potential reduce dispersion but can lower aggregate productivity."
  variables:
    - name: "Total I/K"
      definition: "Total investment rate (investment-to-capital)."
      construction: "Investment divided by total capital, combining physical + intangible components (total capital approach). Often industry-adjusted within 2-digit SIC and used for annual median sorts."
      frequency: "Annual"
      sample: "Compustat firms"
      source: "Compustat + intangible capital construction"
      notes: "Used to form high vs low investment groups."

    - name: "Log MPK"
      definition: "Log marginal product of capital."
      construction: "Firm-level MPK measure (constructed; frequently industry-adjusted relative to 2-digit SIC medians)."
      frequency: "Annual"
      sample: "Compustat firms"
      source: "Compustat (constructed)"
      notes: "Used jointly with investment to define ‘misallocation’ portfolio."

    - name: "High I/K & Low MPK indicator"
      definition: "Investing-in-misallocation group membership."
      construction: "Indicator = 1 if firm is above-median Total I/K and below-median Log MPK within industry-year."
      frequency: "Annual"
      sample: "Compustat firms"
      source: "Constructed from Total I/K and Log MPK"
      notes: "Core empirical object."

    - name: "Jump dummy"
      definition: "Large growth event."
      construction: "Event defined by large increases in sales and MPK (paper’s jump definition; see paper for exact cutoffs and window)."
      frequency: "Event / Annual"
      sample: "Compustat firms"
      source: "Compustat (constructed)"
      notes: "Used to link current investment to future growth options."
